##Hungry Lizard

**Hungry Lizard** is a simple console game in which the main character (hero) – the Hungry Lizard – eats flies to gain points and has to avoid getting killed by losing all five of his lives or losing points by falling bricks. 

There are three kind of flies:
* Eating the Tiny Fly gives 10 points. 
* The Horse Fly - 20 points.
* The Fly Cece gives 30 points. 

The bricks get 100 points from the current score as if the current points are less than 100, the Hungry Lizard dies. 

All this is displayed during the game including the current points and remaining lives. 

There are five levels of difficulty (with increasing speed): 
* Lizard Apprentice;
* Amateur Lizard; 
* Experienced Lizard; 
* Pro Lizard and 
* Ultra Lizard.  

The interface is fairly intuitive. The User can make his choice of level by pressing 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. The main character The Hungry Lizard moves by pressing LEFT or RIGHT arrow keys. In the end of the game by pressing ENTER starts a new game. The other option is pressing ESCAPE to exit.
